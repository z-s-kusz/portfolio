I found it tedious to navigate through the MHW in-game UI to search for information.
So, I created a searchable website to access the game's content quickly.
However, I haven't played since the sequel came out, and when Heroku discontinued its free tier, I decided to stop supporting the site.

<div class="text-blue-400 border-t-2 border-zinc-50 mt-4 pt-4">
React, node, heroku, mongodb, Bootstrap CSS, webpack
</div>
