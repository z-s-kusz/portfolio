My wife was frustrated with the group generators she found online for grouping her class for activities.
She needed something that would support rules during group generation.
So I spun up my own over a few nights after work.

<div class="text-blue-400 border-t-2 border-zinc-50 mt-4 pt-4">
SPA, Vue 2, Bootstrap CSS, webpack
</div>
