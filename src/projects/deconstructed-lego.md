This one is more of a tech test.
I wanted to try out Nuxt and the â€˜Nuxt Content' static site generator.
I thought using images of lego flat lays that I've been making for a few years would be good for the content.

<div class="text-blue-400 border-t-2 border-zinc-50 mt-4 pt-4">
Multi-Page/traditional site, Nuxt, SSG, Vue 3, Vuetify/Material Design, CSS
</div>
