I often take notes in my rpg campaigns through html and markdown (styling after the fact).
It's a fast way to add flair to notes so they feel less static.
I've taken most down since the campaigns (and heroku's free hosting) ended.

<div class="text-blue-400 border-t-2 border-zinc-50 mt-4 pt-4">
HTML5, CSS3, Markdown/yaml, heroku, netlify
</div>
