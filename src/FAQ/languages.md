title: Do you know frameworks besides Vue?
---

Yes! I know <span class="react">React</span> and <span class="angular">Angular2+</span> even better than Vue.
I've been working with them professionally for 7 years.
I've solved more difficult and demanding problems with
<span class="react">React</span> and <span class="angular">Angular</span>
at work than I have in these personal projects,
so I use them as a testing ground for frameworks like Vue, SolidJS and Svelte.
