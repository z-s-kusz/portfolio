title: Do you know Node or other backend languages?
---

Yes! I've professionally written utility scripts and updated many node apis.
I'm primarily a web developer.
Therefore, most of my ideas for personal projects center around the front end which is why you don't see as much node use here.
Really simple things like routing and responding to REST calls have been solved,
so I lean on Netlify hosting and Cloud Functions to get my ideas done faster.
